# 🧠 Teach Me Intelligence — Chapter 1: *Awakening*

An interactive, cinematic web experience that explores how **AI learns to perceive and understand** the world.  
Built with **Tone.js**, **ElevenLabs**, and a custom lightweight backend, it blends sound, visuals, and live AI dialogue.

---

## 🌌 Concept

You awaken a tiny **Core** inside a quiet universe.  
The **Core** represents a newborn AI model — curious, listening, and learning through your interaction.  
Each click you make is a *data point*.  
Repetition creates *patterns*, and patterns become *recognition*.

Two voices guide the experience:

- **Narrator** — calm and observant, explains what’s happening.
- **Core** — a child-like AI voice that learns from your clicks and questions.

The world evolves as you interact — sounds, light, and rhythm adapt dynamically to your actions.

## 🎧 Live AI Mode (New!)

The latest version introduces **real-time AI responses** using the [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) API.

**Features:**
- Real AI-generated voices for both the *Core* and the *Narrator*  
- Strict **speech lock** — no overlapping voices or double responses  
- **Idle hints** when the player stops interacting  
- **Transcript bubbles** that fade in/out as characters speak  
- Smooth **visual feedback**: light shifts, heartbeat pulses, sparkles  
- Local backend with caching for efficient voice reuse
